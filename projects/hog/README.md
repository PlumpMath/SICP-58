The Game of Hog
===============

## Basic Rules

* Two players
* Goal: reach 100 points
* Turn: choose up to 10 dice to roll
* Score: the sum of the dice, unless any die has 1, in which case only one point for the turn ("Pig out")

### Extra Rules

* *Free bacon*: a player can choose zero dice. Their socre is one more than the largest digit in her opponent's current score. E.g., if player 1 has 42 points, player 0 gains 1 + max(4, 2) = 5 points.
* *Hog wild*: If the sum of both players' total scores is a multiple of seven, the current player rolls four-sides dice instead of six-sided.
* *Swine Swap*: If, at the end of a turn, one of the player's total score is exactly double the other's, then they players swap total scores.
