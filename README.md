SICP Book and Simple Scheme
===========================

This started out as notes, code, and experiements from the [SICP book](https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/).

I'm also working through [Simple Scheme](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ss-toc2.html) and will keep my notes here in the same repo.
