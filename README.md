SICP Book and Other Scheme Studies
==================================

This started out as notes, code, and experiements from the [SICP book](https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/).

I'm also looking at [Simply Scheme](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ss-toc2.html) and other Scheme resources.

# Python

I switched to [Composing Programs](http://composingprograms.com/), which is mostly Python, with a bit of Scheme.
